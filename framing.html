    <h1>How Framing Shapes Every Choice</h1>
    <p><strong>What is Framing?</strong> According to Melina Palmer, framing is the way information is presented—and it
        can dramatically alter decisions, even when the underlying facts stay the same.</p>
    <p>On a personal level, I discovered framing when planning my own career pivot. I felt overwhelmed by “risks and
        unknowns.” Then I reframed the same data—skills gained, portfolio work, mentorship opportunities—as “stepping
        stones to leadership”—and suddenly, excitement replaced anxiety.</p>
    <h2>Consumer-Driven Application</h2>
    <p>In your business or role, you can apply framing by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Positive vs. Negative:</strong> A training program can be framed as “90% skill mastery guaranteed”
            rather than “10% failure rate.”</li>
        <li><strong>Before & After Anchors:</strong> Show where a consumer is today (“low conversion”) and where they
            could be tomorrow (“50% more sign-ups”).</li>
        <li><strong>Contextual Cues:</strong> Frame a pricing tier next to a VIP option so the middle tier feels like a
            smart compromise.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Self-Reflection & Growth</h2>
    <p>Ask yourself: how am I framing my own challenges? If you’re stuck on “I should have known this by now,” reframe
        it as “I’m collecting data for continuous improvement.” That mental shift turns pressure into fuel.</p>
