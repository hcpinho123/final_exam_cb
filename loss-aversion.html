    <h1>Leveraging Loss Aversion for Growth</h1>
    <p><strong>What is Loss Aversion?</strong> Palmer explains that people feel losses about twice as strongly as gains.
    </p>
    <p>When I challenged myself to build a morning routine, I framed skipping my workout as “losing a day’s
        productivity.” The fear of that loss made me leap out of bed.</p>
    <h2>Business-Focused Strategies</h2>
    <p>To apply loss aversion in your consumer-centric role:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Free Trials with Expiration:</strong> Offer a trial period that’s about to end—customers hate losing
            access more than they love getting it.</li>
        <li><strong>Limited Guarantees:</strong> “Money-back if you don’t see results in 30 days”—the ticking clock
            triggers action.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Show users a visual bar of their progress (e.g., “80% to goal”)—nobody
            wants progress to slip backward.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Personal Growth Takeaway</h2>
    <p>Set your own “loss” deadlines: commit to reading one chapter daily or donate to a cause if you miss a milestone.
        The discomfort of a tangible loss will drive consistent progress.</p>
